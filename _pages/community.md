## Cloud Native Tampa Bay

**Official CNCF Community Chapter**

Tampa Bay's home for cloud native practitioners, where Kubernetes users, platform engineers, and enterprise AI leaders come together to share knowledge, solve real problems, and grow at every experience level.

<div style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 4px solid #7a8288; padding: 1em; margin: 1.5em 0;">
This isn't a meetup about the latest models or research papers. It's about the infrastructure, compliance, cost optimization, and organizational patterns that separate successful deployments from expensive demos.

## What to Expect

### Hands-On Workshops
We don't just talk about infrastructure. We deploy it. Bring your laptop, follow along, and leave with working code.

### Real-World Case Studies
Learn from practitioners who've shipped production systems in regulated industries. What worked, what didn't, and what they'd do differently.

### No Sales Pitches
This is a practitioner community. Vendors are welcome to participate, but this isn't a place to pitch products.

### Honest Conversations
87% of AI projects fail. Let's talk about why and how to be in the 13% that succeed.
