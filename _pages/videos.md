### Production AI Inference on Your Laptop in 8 Minutes

{% include video id="eZAELyls_Lg" provider="youtube" %}

Deploy production-like AI inference infrastructure on your laptop with a single command. At CNCF Tampa Bay, I demoed kFabric — a tool that collapses the entire KServe stack (Kubernetes, Istio, Prometheus, and more) into an eight-minute setup. Same tools and patterns as production, built for development.
