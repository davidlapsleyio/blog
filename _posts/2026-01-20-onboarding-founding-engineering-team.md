Today I'm onboarding the founding engineers at Actualyze. I've worked with all of them before. Excited to be getting the band back together.

These engineers have built production systems that process billions of requests. They've led platform teams and they have the scars to prove it (late night debugging at 3am anyone?). They're passionate about what they do and know how to have fun.

## What makes this team different

**They've shipped things that had to work.** Not demos. Not prototypes. Infrastructure that handled real load, real failures, and real business pressure. Systems where downtime costs money and bugs cascade across services.

**They know the gap between working and scaling.** Anyone can get something running on their laptop. Getting it to handle production load with high availability is a different problem. This team has solved that problem multiple times.

**They know how to use LLMs.** We're not doing the "AI will replace engineers" thing. We're using [spec-driven development](/engineering/process/best%20practices/ai-assisted%20development/2026/01/11/spec-driven-development-with-llms/) to let senior engineers write specifications that LLMs execute. One expert writing requirements can enable work that used to need 10x the people.

Time to build.
