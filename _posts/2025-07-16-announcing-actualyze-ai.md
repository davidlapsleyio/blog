One year ago, I decided to leave Amazon Web Services to start my own company. Since then I've had the chance to meet some amazing people, build some incredible technology, work hands-on across all parts of the agentic stack, and reimagine what's possible.

Today, I'm excited to share that I've joined forces with a few of my former colleagues to co-found a new company: [ActualyzeAI](https://actualyze.ai/).

We're building in stealth, but the mission is ambitious and the team is world-class. I'm proud to be taking on the role of CTO, working alongside Rafi Khardalian (CEO) and Sean Lynch (CSO). We bring together deep expertise across engineering, product, and strategy, and we're leveraging the foundation I built over the past year to go even further.

More to follow soon. For now, I'm just incredibly grateful for the journey so far, and fired up for what's ahead!
