## Welcome!

Hi, I'm David! With decades of experience building and managing infrastructure platforms at AWS, Cisco, Startups, and now as CTO of [ActualyzeAI](https://www.actualyze.ai), I help enterprises navigate the journey from AI proof-of-concept to production deployment. This blog shares battle-tested patterns, real-world case studies, and practical strategies for the 13% of AI projects that actually make it to production.

**Why 87% of AI projects fail isn't a technical problem (it's a planning problem). Let's fix that.**
