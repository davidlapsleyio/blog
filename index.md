## Welcome!
{: .text-center}

Hi, I'm Dave! With 25+ years building infrastructure platforms at AWS, Cisco, and now as CTO of [ActualyzeAI](https://www.actualyze.ai), I help enterprises navigate the journey from AI proof-of-concept to production deployment. This blog shares battle-tested patterns, real-world case studies, and practical strategies for the 13% of AI projects that actually make it to production.
