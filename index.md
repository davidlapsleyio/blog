## Welcome!

Hi, I'm David. I've spent my career building production systems at AWS, Cisco, and now as CTO of [ActualyzeAI](https://www.actualyze.ai) from distributed infrastructure to AI platforms to engineering teams that ship.

This blog covers what I've learned building systems that actually work: **enterprise AI infrastructure**, **LLM-assisted development workflows**, **Kubernetes platforms**, **engineering culture**, and the **distributed systems patterns** that separate demos from production.

Whether you're deploying AI at scale, building with LLMs, or leading engineering teams, you'll find battle-tested patterns and real-world lessons from someone who's been there.

<strong>If you're building production systems, not just prototypes, you're in the right place.</strong>
