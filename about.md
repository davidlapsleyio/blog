<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.125em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">David Lapsley, Ph.D.</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.125em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><strong>CTO, <a href="https://www.actualyze.ai">ActualyzeAI</a></strong></p>

I build high-performing engineering teams and empower them to deliver enterprise-grade AI infrastructure and robust, scalable distributed systems. My focus is on production systems that work under real-world conditions, not just in demos.

## What I Do

At ActualyzeAI, I help enterprises deploy production-grade AI infrastructure. Most companies struggle with the 87% failure rate in AI projects. We focus on the fundamentals: enterprise-grade distributed systems, scalable infrastructure, and engineering practices that work at scale.

## Background

I've spent my career building distributed systems and infrastructure platforms at scale:

### [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com)
**Director** - AWS Intent Driven Networks, Network Fabric Controllers  
Led teams building the networking infrastructure that powers AWS's AI workloads

### [Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com)
**Director** - Cisco Container Platform, DNA Center Maglev Platform, Contiv.io  
Built container orchestration and network automation platforms for enterprise

### [Metacloud](https://www.cisco.com) (acquired by Cisco)
**VP Engineering** - Managed OpenStack as a Service  
Led engineering through acquisition, scaling the team and platform

### [Corelight](https://www.corelight.com)
**VP Engineering** - Network Intrusion Detection  
Built security infrastructure for critical enterprise networks

### Earlier Career
**[BBN Technologies](https://www.raytheon.com/ourcompany/bbn), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov), [MIT Haystack Observatory](https://www.haystack.mit.edu)**  
Research and development in distributed systems, networking protocols, and high-performance data acquisition

## Philosophy

The 87% who fail try to find the perfect architecture. The 13% who succeed make deliberate trade-offs and ship production systems.

This blog is for the 13%. Whether you're wrestling with GPU costs, navigating compliance requirements, or trying to get your first model to production, you'll find practical guidance based on real production experience.

**Let's build systems that actually work.**
